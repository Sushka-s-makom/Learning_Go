# Learning Go

This repository contains my practice code while learning the Go programming language.
It covers core language features and basic standard library usage.

## Topics covered
- Variables, constants, and basic types
- Control flow: if, for, switch
- Arrays, slices, maps
- Strings and runes
- Structs
- Functions and basic error handling
- Time-based logic with switch

## Structure
- `cmd/` — entry point for running examples
- `basics/` — language fundamentals
- `collections/` — arrays, slices, maps
- `types/` — structs and string-related topics
- `function/` — functions and error handling examples

## How to run
```bash
go run ./cmd
